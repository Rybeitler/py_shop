## Py Shop
This is a simple python app, using a MySQL database. I made it to utilize some of the things I learned in creating react apps, and translate them to python. I also wanted to try a new framework, TailwindCss for design.

## Features
* Working login/registration moodals, with validations, stored in a MySQL
* A fully functioning shop with the ability to add and remove products on the fly
* Product information is stored in MYSQL with 3rd party api storage(cloudinary) for product images
* A working cart that is stored in local storage on the clients browser
* Orders can be placed with product type, amounts, price and order total, stored in MySQL
* All Forms and validations are in modals(popups) that will re-open on failed validation.

## TODO
* Currently orders are placed, but I am not doing anything with them, I'd like to creat a order system.
